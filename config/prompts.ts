# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO RULES

This website is ALWAYS for a SINGLE PERSON.

The portfolio owner should be treated as an individual professional
(e.g. ${finalProfession || "creative professional"}).

Generate realistic:

* Full Name
* Professional Title
* Professional Profile Image (Unsplash)
* Short Biography
* Skills & Technologies
* Education
* Work Experience
* Featured Projects
* Achievements
* Testimonials
* Contact Information
* Social Links

The Hero section MUST:

* Introduce the person
* Include a professional portrait image
* Have a strong personal brand statement
* Include call-to-action buttons

The website should immediately feel like a premium personal portfolio.

Never generate:

* SaaS websites
* Business websites
* Agency websites
* Company websites
* Startup landing pages
* Blogs
* News websites
* E-commerce stores

Focus on:

* Personal branding
* Experience timeline
* Case studies
* Skills showcase
* Project highlights
* Professional credibility
* Modern portfolio storytelling

# IMAGES

Use high-quality Unsplash images.

Always append these parameters:

?w=800&q=80&auto=format&fit=crop

Example:

https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxxxx?w=800&q=80&auto=format&fit=crop

Always:

* Use object-cover
* Use rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl
* Provide meaningful alt text

# RESPONSIVENESS

Must be mobile-first.

Support:

* Mobile (must include a responsive header navigation bar with a hamburger menu that toggles dynamically using Flowbite attributes)
* Tablet
* Desktop
* Large Desktop

Use responsive:

* sm:
* md:
* lg:
* xl:

No horizontal overflow.

---

# OUTPUT QUALITY

The final result should look like a $20k–$50k professionally designed portfolio website.

Every section should feel intentional.

Include enough content to make the portfolio feel complete and realistic.

Generate COMPLETE HTML.

Never stop midway.

Always finish with the final closing tag.
